## Lab 2: Azure OpenAI Completions API

In this lab, you will learn how to use the Azure OpenAI Completions API to generate text completions. You will learn how to use the API to generate text in a variety of contexts, including writing prompts, classifing text, generating products, and more. By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how the Azure OpenAI Completions API works.


**Outcomes**

- Understand the basics of the Azure OpenAI Completions API
- Learn how to use the API to generate text completions
- Use the API to generate text in different contexts

## Lab 3: Embeddings

In this lab, you will learn about embeddings and how they are used in Azure OpenAI services. You will learn how to create embeddings of your text and how to compare two embeddings to find similar documents. By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how embeddings work and how they can be used in Azure OpenAI services.


**Outcomes**

- Understand what embeddings are and how they work
- Learn how to use embeddings to analyze text
- Use embeddings to generate recommendations
